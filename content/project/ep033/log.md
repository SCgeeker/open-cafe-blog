#### [Unconf---Getting psychology to the people: creating topical 'Wikis' that target crisis-relevant issues](https://osf.io/vw84u/)

[SciBeh](https://www.scibeh.org/): A team project bridge the researchers and public about COVID-19 related sciences

Leading Qs:

-   a situation where you felt uncomfortable giving your honest scientific opinion or critique S

-   Is scientific debate currently structured in such a way as to promote constructive criticism?

Topics the attenders discussed on Unconf: [https://hackmd.io/\@scibeh-sips/welcome](https://hackmd.io/@scibeh-sips/welcome)

Topic 1: How do we connect researchers and public needs?

Topic 2: How do we make researchers comfortable adding their voices to scientific spaces? **I joined this.**

To create a space everyone can discuss the sceintific topic we are focusing.

Social norm is matter.

What kind of tools could help scientists discuss the arguments with each other?

#### [Unconf---How can we improve Registered Reports for authors, reviewers, and editors?](https://osf.io/8qkda/)

Leaders' projects:

RR now

Comparative database of Registered report

-   Accessibility

How do we define accessibility in the context of Registered Report?

Are there any issues with this article format that do not apply to standard articles?\
If yes, how can these be sovled and how do we improve overall accessibility of RR?

> From NL RR applicant's experience. It's sad becuase replication has to connect the original study.

> Assertive works relatively well for a large amount of cases :)

-   How to build a good Guideline for RR?

-   Triangle issues among funder, ethics, and publication

Olivia Kirtley對所有人說： 12:49 AM \@Emma - Good question! In the first instance, initial preparation of a clinical ethics application can take longer than a standard ethics application. Often additional paperwork needed because you're recruiting patients and/or 'vulnerable' minors. Then medical ethics committees just seem to be slower than psych dept ethics committees for unknown reasons. Because there tend to be few(er) psychologists/psychiatrists on medical ethics committees, you also often get a lot of left-of-field questions, as they are mainly familiar with clinical trial research. These can result in more rounds of review, which all take time.

#### [Hack---Bridging the gap between research and the public: Building an online resource repository of best practices for public engagement and research communication](https://osf.io/5trsb/)

This Hack came from 0623 Uncon-How can we improve Registered Reports for authors, reviewers, and editors? Discussions on Topic 1: How do we connect researchers and public needs?

We have started the document for this work in progress: <https://hackmd.io/lGrIVleUTsOumHOw4AXEbg>

### [(Too) many shades of reaction time data preprocessing---a hackathon](https://osf.io/mnv7w/)

This Hack followed the unconf at the 6/23. I missed that because it was too late.
The hosts had the introduction slide about this topic: https://osf.io/hyprj/

Krzysztof(Host) is considering mutliverse analysis as the potential approach to analyze reaction time data. I have to take some time to check Julia's talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6VAwzwZ3K8

(common sense) Researchers analyze the data based on the prior assumed model.

boundary of RT: too slow/too fast to measure the targeted processing

(Julia asked about) speed-accuracy tardeoff: You can calculate Inverse Efficiency Score, which controls for Speed-accuracy trade-off. (from Ekaterina)

It's hard to have a uni-systematic framework to analyze the RTs collected from a variety of cognitive tasks.

Make a check list for RT analysis in each specific circumstance. We may run a survey about what are the elements a checklist we require. Researchers could specify what kind of decisions they have to make in the analysis routines.


### [Workshop---How to write a plain summary of your research: Gain new perspectives and open up your research to a wider audience](https://osf.io/hvtxw/)

I join this workshop for running this podcast. Every attender have their own reasons to learn writing plain summary. 

One of the hosts (Anita Chasiotis) was the author of the article I shared in EP29.

Some reference:

Check the points in the [slide](https://osf.io/u8t74/)

Boost mouth questions:

- Who do you want the audience of your research to be?



- Reasons to use plain language




- Reasons to use jargon 


My practice on [PSA002 plan abstract](https://psyarxiv.com/t2pjv/):

This project will investigate if people comprehend the sentences in mind as like they recognize the objects in the real words. Our assumption came from the findings of sentence-picture verification task in which people would recognize the objects faster after they read the sentence implied the objects with the consistent shape or color. There was the issue that not all the experiments had consistent results on the sentences implied the object orientations, for example, horizontal or vertical. 


Questions in Rewrite my abstract:

What was easy?

What was difficult?

What did surprise me?


"goodness" measure calculator is available in my TG.

- Thoughts, Discussions and notes:

"Psychology is how the mind works, not how the average of a bunch of minds work." Very quotable point by @Alex Holcombe


What are the other factors decide power in addition to the number of participants (classical n)?

"“Brains are wired in the same way” is only sensible if you’re talking about low-level phenomena where you don’t expect individual differences. When you get into social perception, you expect individual differences all over the place. But can we rely on intuitions to tell which is which?" by Lisa Debruine

Some attenders supported this idea:
"Would it be worth drafting a list of DOs and DON'Ts when generalizing from small N experiments?"" by @Steve Haroz




Homogeneity seems to be the necessity to build a small n study. While heterogeneity happened, there are different ways to solve it. Attenders have their own favorite solutions respectively.

Small n study could be the final evidence for building a generative modeling?
